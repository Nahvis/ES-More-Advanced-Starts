# Multiple-Starts
This is a plugin that adds even more starting options to the space-trading video game, Endless-Sky.

These are mostly tuned around multi-purpose use, ship capturing, or bribing pirates to join their faction more quickly. They can be used for trade but typically lack shields or weapons.

This mod was based of the ES Advanced Starts Mod by Bereskatuket (Kestrel1110). Found at https://endless-sky.github.io/plugins.html

It was created for my own enjoyment so I haven't changed much of the dialogue options or graphics yet, and may never get around to it.
